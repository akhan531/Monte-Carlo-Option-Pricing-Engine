    "## Introduction & Project Context ##\n",
    "In finance, options are contracts that give the buyer the right, not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a strike price on or before the expiration date. Among many, the two most common styles of option contracts are European and American. For European-style options, the contract can only be exercised at expiration, so the Black-Scholes PDE can be applied to find a closed-form solution for the price of the option. However, American-style options can be exercised anytime before expiration, which introduces an early exercise boundary. For this reason, no straightforward PDE can be solved to find a formula for the price of the option. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several techniques for attempting to price American options, but for this project, I will be focusing on the widely used Monte-Carlo method called the **Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm**. As machine learning models become more advanced in their predictive power, I will be exploring how different ML models can be used to perform the regression within the LS algorithm for pricing American options.\n",

    "## How the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm works ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The LS algorithm has several parameters regarding the initial behavior of the stock and conditions of the option contract:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S_0 = \\text{Intial stock price}$\n",
    "- $r = \\text{Risk-Free interest rate}$\n",
    "- $\\sigma = \\text{Volatility}$\n",
    "- $T = \\text{Time to expiration}$\n",
    "- $K = \\text{Strike price}$\n",
    "- $n_{trials} = \\text{number of simulated paths}$\n",
    "- $n_{timesteps} = \\text{number of timesteps per path}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm uses Monte Carlo simulations to generate different potential paths that the underlying asset may go through. It leverages a backward recursive approach and regression to estimate the expected value of the option. The expected value is compared to the current exercise value to find the optimal payoff at each timestep. The average of all the simulated option prices is taken to determine the final price of the option.\n"

    "## Choice of Models ##\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I carefully chose four different machine learning approaches for the regression component within the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm. For all models, the inputs are the stock prices for in-the-money paths only and the targets are discounted expected values of the option at the next timestep:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polynomial Regression**\n",
    "  - **Reason I chose this model:** This is the traditional baseline model that is typically implemented in the LS algorithm. It is computationally efficient, and should perform well in capturing the exercise boundary if it can be described by a polynomial.\n",
    "  - **How it fits in the LS Algorithm:** At every timestep, the model tries to fit a polynomial of degree 3 for a function to find expected values of the option based on the current stock price. Predictions from this model come from the determined polynomial.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Random Forest**\n",
    "  - **Reason I chose this model:** A random forest model could do a better job in this handling potential discontinuities that polynomial regression would not be able to handle. It can capture non-linear exercise boundaries without assuming an overall functional form.\n",
    "  - **How it fits in the LS Algorithm:** At every timestep, the model creates several decision trees to categorize the expected value of the option based on the current stock price. It then averages the results from these trees for the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **XGBoost**\n",
    "  - **Reason I chose this model:** This model could potentially be more efficient and robust than random forest. While both are ensemble algorithms, the sequential boosting in XGBoost could capture a lot more details that could be missed from the parallel bagging in random forest. Also, regularization will help model to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "  - **How it fits in the LS Algorithm:** At every timestep, the model uses gradient boosting to sequentially add weak learners, each correcting previous errors to create a final robust learner. This final learner will be able to predict expected values of the option based on the current stock price. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**\n",
    "  - **Reason I chose this model:** This model could theoretically outperform all other models given the correct hyperparameter tuning and regularization. Neural networks work well with large amounts of data, so using it in an algorithm that also uses Monte Carlo Simulation could have promising results.\n",
    "  - **How it fits in the LS Algorithm:** At every timestep, layers of neurons are created, implicitly discovering its own relevant features and finding more nuanced patterns in the data. Then, using backpropagation, the MLP assigns weights to each neuron to create a universal function approximator capable of learning complex stock price to continuation value mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my benchmark, all ML-enhanced Longstaff-Schwartz results are compared against the **Binomial Tree model**, a widely accepted lattice-based pricing method that provides reliable American option valuations. This method starts at a root node with the value of $S_0$. A binary tree is created, branching into possible upward and downward paths at each step. Then, using backward induction, the option value at each node is calculated as the maximum of the immediate exercise value or the discounted expected future value based on risk-neutral probabilities.\n"

    "\n",
    "To make sense of these results and increase the accuracy of the models, I analyzed possible reasons of why models behaved the way they did.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1st place: MLP (RMSE ~ 110)**\n",
    "  - **Hyperparameter Analysis:** I used sklearn's default hyperparamaeters for this model, which seem to work surprisingly well.\n",
    "    - The architecture was a **single hidden layer** with **100 neurons**. Having this large amount of neurons for just a single layer gives more than enough opportunities to approximate exercise boundary given that it is simple. However, if there are more complex patterns to be discovered, implementing a hierarchical architecture might be able to refine decisions and generalize better.\n",
    "    - The activation function was **ReLU**. This is standard for MLPs, and I see no reason why any other activation function could be yield significantly better results, so I will keep this.\n",
    "    - The learning rate is controled through an **Adam optimizer**. This solver approximates the gradient and adjusts the learning rate accordingly. I will stick with this, as is much more robust than a fixed learning rate. With this, I will also keep the **initial learning rate** to **0.001**, which is a low enough value for Adam not to explode.\n",
    "    - The **maximum number of iterations** is **200**. When I run the LS algorithm with this low of a threshold, I tend to get warnings alerting me that the optmization has not stably converged, so the loss is not as minmized as it could be.\n",
    "  - **Improvements**\n",
    "    - I will change the architecture to **two hidden layer** with **64 neurons** each. \n",
    "    - I will experiment with **larger maximum number of iterations** to ensure convergence during training.\n",
    "    - I will add **early stopping** to the MLP so that even if maximum number of iterations has not been met yet, it can prematurely stop the optimization process if loss has seemed to stabilize. I will use **Mean Squared Error** to determine early stopping requirements, basing it directly off of loss instead of R^2. I will further implement a **validation split** of 0.2 so that the MLP can use 20% of the data to track convergence.\n",
    "    - I will try to **increase alpha** for L2 regularization to catch my model if it is overfitting from noise in the Monte Carlo simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **2nd place: Polynomial Regression (RMSE ~ 165)**\n",
    "  - **Hyperparameter Analysis:** I intially only set two hyperparameters for the model.\n",
    "    - I set the **degree of the polynomial** to **3**. I saw this value in other implementations for the LS algorithm, so I thought it would capture most of the exercise boundary without heavily overfitting.\n",
    "    - I set **fit_intercept** to **false**. I had intially thought that there wouldn't be too much of a difference if I force the polynomial to go through 0, but now realizing that I have not centered my stock prices, which are the features of the model, I shouldn't assume to function passes through the origin.\n",
    "  - **Improvements**\n",
    "    - I will experiment with **different degrees for the polynomial** to see which one may result in the best fit. I will check polynomials with **degrees 2 to 6**, not going too high to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "    - I will set **fit_intercept** to **true**. This will make the model learn an additional bias term (y-intercept), so the polynomial might be able to fit better with this axial leeway.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **3rd place: Random Forest (RMSE ~ 240)**\n",
    "  - **Hyperparameter Analysis:** I used sklearn's default hyperparamaeters for this model.\n",
    "    - The model used **100 trees** for bagging. This value is relatively low, which allows each iteration within the LS algorithm to run faster, but a larger forest might lead to better stability in results.\n",
    "    - The trees themselves had **unlimited depth**, which means all the trees grew until they perfectly fit whatever subset of the training set they were trained on. This may lead to overfitting from noise in the various simulations.\n",
    "  - **Improvements**\n",
    "    - I will experiment with a **higher amount of trees** to see if it can stabilize the results.\n",
    "    - I will **limit the depth of trees**. This could not only make the model run faster, but generalize better due to simplfied decision tree.\n",
    "    - Since I only train my models off of one feature of stock price, I will set **max_features = 1**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **4th place: XGBoost (RMSE ~ 290)**\n",
    "  - **Hyperparameter Analysis:** I used sklearn's default hyperparamaeters for this model.\n",
    "    - The **learning rate** was at a constant **0.3**. Given all the noise in the Monte Carlo simulations, this is far too high for an appropriate learning rate.\n",
    "    - The model used **100 trees** for boosting. This value is relatively low, which allows each iteration within the LS algorithm to run faster. However, if I decrease the learning rate, I should increase the amount of trees I use to restabilize my results.\n",
    "    - The trees themselves had **max depth** of **6**. This is fine, but smaller trees may generalize slightly better.\n",
    "    - **L1 Regularization** is **0** as default. Since I only have one feature, I will keep this value at 0.\n",
    "    - **L2 Regularization** is **1** as default. It is difficult for me to quantify how much of my simulations are just noise, so I want to play with this value to see if I can further prevent my model from overfitting.\n",
    "    - The **minimum loss reduction to split (gamma)** is **0.1**. This is another measure to control generalization of the model within trees.\n",
    "    - The **fraction of training data per tree** is **1.0**, meaning all the data is being used. Given the scarcity of the ITM paths at every timestep, I am inclined to keep this value at 1.0, regardless if 1 or 2 paths might include noise.\n",
    "    - The **fraction of features per tree** is **1.0.** I will keep this value, since I only have one feature.\n",
    "  - **Improvements**\n",
    "    - I will **decrease the learning rate**. With smaller steps towards minimizing the loss function, the path to convergece will be much more smooth, and less likely to overshoot the precise value the could be found from gradient descent.\n",
    "    - I will experiment with a **higher amount of trees** to see if it can stabilize the results. However, I will optimize the efficiency of the model by adding **early stopping** to the model so it can prematurely stop the optimization process if loss has seemed to stabilize, which may eliminate the requirement to get rid of all trees.\n",
    "    - I will experiment with **shallower trees** to see if a simplified tree architecture can generalize better to unseen data. \n",
    "    - I will experiment with **lower reg_lambda values** to smooth my predictions.\n",
    "    - I will experiment with **different gamma values** to see how conservative I can make my model without negatively impacting its accuracy.\n",

    "After considering the structure of the LS algorithm, I determined that additional features beyond stock price would be redundant. Since I train a fresh model at each timestep, parameters like K, σ, r, and time remaining are constants within each training set. Therefore, any transformation of stock price (moneyness, Greeks proxies, etc.) provides no additional information beyond the raw stock price itself. This insight led me to focus optimization efforts on hyperparameter tuning rather than feature engineering, which is more appropriate for this problem structure."
