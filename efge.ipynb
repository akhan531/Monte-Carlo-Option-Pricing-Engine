    "In finance, options are contracts that give the buyer the right, not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a strike price on or before the expiration date. Among many, the two most common styles of option contracts are European and American. For European-style options, the contract can only be exercised at expiration, so we can apply the Black-Scholes PDE to find a closed-form solution for the price of the option. However, American-style options can be exercised anytime before expiration, which introduces an early exercise boundary. For this reason, no straightforward PDE can be solved to find a formula for the price of the option. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several techniques for attempting to price American options, but for this project, I will be focusing on the widely used Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm. This algorithm uses Monte Carlo simulations to generate different potential paths that the underlying asset may go through. It leverages a backward recursive approach and regression to estimate the expected value of the option. The expected value is compared to the current exercise value to find the optimal payoff at each timestep. The average of all the simulated option prices is taken to determine the final price of the option.\n"
